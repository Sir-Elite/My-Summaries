# Shell Commands

------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Introduction to Git ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Print Working directory:
    pwd

### 2. Returing a list of the files and directories in the current location (working directory):
#### 2.a. Showing the unhidden files and directories
    ls
#### 2.b. Showing all the files and directories including hidden ones
    ls -a

### 3. Change Directory:
    cd [directory_location]/[directory_name]

### 4. Editing a File:
#### 4.a. nano
    nano [filename]
This command opens a text editor on the file mentioned. It is used to delete, add or change content of a file.
#### 4.b. echo
    echo "text content" > filename_to_be_created.txt
    echo "text content" >> filename_for_text_to_be_appeneded.txt
#### Then to:
* Save Changes: "Ctrl" + "O"
* Exit the Editor: "Ctrl" + "X"

### 5. Checking Git Version:
    git --version

### 6. Saving drafts of ....... into Staging Area:
#### 6.a. Specific File:
    git add [filename]
#### 6.b. All Files in the current location:
    git add .

### 7. Commit our drafts:
    git commit -m "log message"
-m flag allows us to include a log message about our commit, placing it in quotes. This log message is useful for reference, so it is kept short and concise.

### 8. Checking the status of files (which are in Staging Area, and which have changes that are not in the Staging Area yet):
    git status

### 9. Comparing the last committed version of a file with the ...... :
#### 9.a. Unstaged Version of the same file:
    git diff [unstaged_filename]
#### 9.b. Staged Version of the same file:
    git diff -r HEAD [staged_filename]
-r flag to look at particular revision of the file. HEAD is a shortcut for the most recenet commit's hash. And the 'git diff -r' will not work without 'HEAD'.
#### 9.c. Multiple Staged Versions of the same file:
    git diff -r HEAD

#### # The output of an example on a file called report.md:
![image](https://github.com/Sir-Elite/My-Summaries/assets/66035383/0f627b1e-45fe-4ce0-9f73-1caa8a1edce0)

* a --> first version (committed).
* b --> second version (unstaged).
* -1,5 --> '-' means in version a, '1' beginning from line 1, and '5' 5 lines are extracted.
* +1,5 --> '+' means in version a, '1' beginning from line 1, and '5' 5 lines are extracted.
* line preceded by '-' was in version a, but not in b. And vice versa with the line preceded by '+'.

-------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Making Changes -------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Selecting the Version for comparison:
#### 10.a. Last (first most recent) version:
    git diff -r HEAD [staged_filename]
#### 10.b. Second most recent version:
    git diff -r HEAD~1 [staged_filename]
#### 10.a. Third most recent version:
    git diff -r HEAD~2 [staged_filename]

### 11. Comparison of two commits:
    git diff [hash1] [hash2]
##### or
    git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2

### 12. Getting the Commit Structure:
#### 12.a. All commits:
    git log
#### 12.b. Last N commits:
    git log -[N]
#### 12.c. For Specific File:
    git log [filename]
#### 12.d. Restricted to a date:
    git log --since='Month Day Year' --until="Month Day Year"
* Month ---> Three letter abbreviation
* Day ---> one or two digits
* Year ---> four digits
* They can be replaced between single or double quotations.
* --until ---> is optional

### 13. Showing Commit in turn:
#### 13.a. using 6-8 characters of the hash
    git show [hash]
#### 13.b using HEAD~
    git show HEAD~3
This command shows the fourth most recent commit.
#### # The output of an example on a file called mental_health_survey.csv:
![image](https://github.com/Sir-Elite/My-Summaries/assets/66035383/8aa85b24-29a5-4e2d-bf94-5164d95d23fa)

The error here is gender in the first column instead of the second column.
### 14. View Changes per Document by Line:
    git annotate [filename.extension]
#### # The output of an example on a file called report.md:
![image](https://github.com/Sir-Elite/My-Summaries/assets/66035383/79157ef5-7252-4644-9c27-7e46d8f6e57c)

### 15. Unstaging Files:
#### 15.a. Single File:
    git reset HEAD [filename]
#### 15.b. All Files:
    git reset HEAD

### 16. Undo changes to ....... :
#### 16.a. One unstaged file to the last commit:
    git checkout -- [filename]
#### 16.b. One unstaged at specific commit:
    git chechout [hash] [filename]
##### or
    git checkout HEAD~[N] [filename]
#### 16.c. All unstaged files in the current directory and subdirectories to the last commit:
    git checkout .
#### 16.d. All unstaged files in the current directory and subdirectories at specific commit:
    git chechout [hash]
##### or
    git checkout HEAD~[N]

* checkout: switching to a different version (default: last version).
* The changes are lost forever for them being never committed (saved).

### 17. Cleaning Repositories:
#### 17.a. See untracked files (never committed, which is very recently created or copied from another project):
    git clean -n
#### 17.b. Delete those files:
    git clean -f
##### # git clean -f cannot be undone.

----------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Git Workflows -------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 18. Git Settings Configuration:
#### 18.a. list configuration commands
    git config --list
#### 18.b. Setting email address
    git config --global user.email example@company.com
#### 18.c. Setting user name
    git config --global user.name "First_Name Last_Name"
#### 18.d. Aliasing to shorten reset HEAD command to unstage(can be applied to any other)
    git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD'
#### 18.e. Listing system commands
    git config --system --list

### 19. Ignoring Specific Files:
#### 19.1. Create a file called ".gitignore"
    nano .gitignore
#### 19.2. Within this file write the regex of the file type to be ignored (example: each file ends with .log)
    *.log

### 20. Identifying Exisiting Branches:
    git branch
we get a list of branches. In which, we have a branch name perceeded by '*' which is the existing branch.

### 21. Creating a Branch
    git checkout -b branch_name

### 22. Switching Branch
    git checkout branch_name

### 23. The difference between Branches
    git diff branch1_name branch2_name
This produces a standard "git diff" output.
