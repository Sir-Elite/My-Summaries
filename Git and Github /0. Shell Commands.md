# Shell Commands

------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Introduction to Git ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Print Working directory:
    pwd

### 2. Returing a list of the files and directories in the current location (working directory):
#### 2.a. Showing the unhidden files and directories
    ls
#### 2.b. Showing all the files and directories including hidden ones
    ls -a

### 3. Change Directory:
    cd [directory_location]/[directory_name]

### 4. Editing a File:
#### 4.a. nano
    nano [file_name.extension]
This command opens a text editor on the file mentioned. It is used to delete, add or change content of a file.
#### 4.b. echo
    echo "text content" > file_name_to_be_created.txt
    echo "text content" >> file_name_for_text_to_be_appeneded.txt
#### Then to:
* Save Changes: "Ctrl" + "O"
* Exit the Editor: "Ctrl" + "X"

### 5. Checking Git Version:
    git --version

### 6. Saving drafts of ....... into Staging Area:
#### 6.a. Specific File:
    git add [file_name.extension]
#### 6.b. All Files in the current location:
    git add .

### 7. Commit our drafts:
    git commit -m "log message"
-m flag allows us to include a log message about our commit, placing it in quotes. This log message is useful for reference, so it is kept short and concise.

### 8. Checking the status of files (which are in Staging Area, and which have changes that are not in the Staging Area yet):
    git status

### 9. Comparing the last committed version of a file with the ...... :
#### 9.a. Unstaged Version of the same file:
    git diff [unstaged_file_name.extension]
#### 9.b. Staged Version of the same file:
    git diff -r HEAD [staged_file_name.extension]
-r flag to look at particular revision of the file. HEAD is a shortcut for the most recenet commit's hash. And the 'git diff -r' will not work without 'HEAD'.
#### 9.c. Multiple Staged Versions of the same file:
    git diff -r HEAD

#### # The output of an example on a file called report.md:
![image](https://github.com/Sir-Elite/My-Summaries/assets/66035383/0f627b1e-45fe-4ce0-9f73-1caa8a1edce0)

* a --> first version (committed).
* b --> second version (unstaged).
* -1,5 --> '-' means in version a, '1' beginning from line 1, and '5' 5 lines are extracted.
* +1,5 --> '+' means in version a, '1' beginning from line 1, and '5' 5 lines are extracted.
* line preceded by '-' was in version a, but not in b. And vice versa with the line preceded by '+'.

-------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Making Changes -------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Selecting the Version for comparison:
#### 10.a. Last (first most recent) version:
    git diff -r HEAD [staged_file_name.extension]
#### 10.b. Second most recent version:
    git diff -r HEAD~1 [staged_file_name.extension]
#### 10.a. Third most recent version:
    git diff -r HEAD~2 [staged_file_name.extension]

### 11. Comparison of two commits:
    git diff hash1 hash2
##### or
    git diff HEAD~1 HEAD~2

### 12. Getting the Commit Structure:
    git log

### 13. Showing Commit in turn:
#### 13.a. using 6-8 characters of the hash
    git show hash
#### 13.b using HEAD~
    git show HEAD~3
This command shows the fourth most recent commit.
#### # The output of an example on a file called mental_health_survey.csv:
![image](https://github.com/Sir-Elite/My-Summaries/assets/66035383/8aa85b24-29a5-4e2d-bf94-5164d95d23fa)
