## Git Workflow
we can configure the git settings to satisfy user's needs.

### Git has three levels of settings:
1. system: settings for every user using this computer
2. gloal: settings of all of my projects
3. local: settings for a specific project

### Files usually get ignored:
1. APIs
2. Credentials
3. System files
4. Software Dependencies
