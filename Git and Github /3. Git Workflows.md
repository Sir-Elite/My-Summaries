## Git Workflow
we can configure the git settings to satisfy the user's needs.

### Git has three levels of settings:
1. system: settings for every user using this computer
2. global: settings of all of my projects
3. local: settings for a specific project

### Files usually get ignored:
1. APIs
2. Credentials
3. System files
4. Software Dependencies

### Branches:
Git uses branches to control versions of files and subdirectories from different users. Sometimes we need a copy of the project to edit and try some services without risking the main project getting corrupted. So, we take a branch or a copy of the project to work on and push it, if it works properly (minimizing the risk of conflicting versions). Moreover, branches allow us to keep making progress concurrently by testing the code and debugging copies or branches of the code.

Each branch should be used for a specific task by a specific person.

#### Example 1 Representing How to Perform a Branch/Task, then Merge:

#### Example 2 Explaining Branches Workflow:

1. Main is the default name Git provides to the project creation branch.
2. Took branch from the main called analysis to analyze the data.
3. After two commits in the analysis branch, the report branch was initialized which looks identical to the second commit in the analysis branch.
4. The analysis branch got merged into the main branch (Analysis is the source and Main is the destination).
5. After two more commits in the report branch, we merge it as well into the main branch.

### Handling Conflicts:
Conflicts happen when we try to merge the same files from different branches, but the versions in each branch are different. Sometimes, git automatic fixing, which is not always good enough. Then, we need to open the conflicting file to resolve the conflict. This process is okay for simple fixes and differences, but for large conflicts, the process gets quite intimidating. Finally, git informs us after the conflict is resolved "Already up to date.".

#### To reduce conflicts we should:
1. Know that prevention is better than cure!
2. Use each branch for a specific task (as mentioned before).
3. Avoid editing a file in multiple branches.

We should know that we cannot guarantee we will avoid conflicts, we can just reduce the probability of having one.

#### Example of an automatically fixed conflict:

Between "<<<<<<< HEAD" and "=======" is the extra of the source branch. This extra TODO can be removed with the extra lines from the fix like this to solve the conflict:
