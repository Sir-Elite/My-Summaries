## Git Workflow
we can configure the git settings to satisfy user's needs.

### Git has three levels of settings:
1. system: settings for every user using this computer
2. gloal: settings of all of my projects
3. local: settings for a specific project

### Files usually get ignored:
1. APIs
2. Credentials
3. System files
4. Software Dependencies

### Branches:
Git uses branches to control versions of files and subdirectories from different users. Sometimes we need a copy of the project to edit and try some services without risking the main project to get corrupted. So, we take a branch or a copy of the project to work on and push it, if it it works properly (minimizing the risk of conflicting versions).

#### In this example:
1. Main is the default name Git provides to project creation branch.
2. Took branch from the main called analysis to analyze the data.
3. After two commits in analysis branch, the report branch got initialized which looks identical to the second commit in analysis branch.
4. Analysis branch got merged into the main branch (Analysis is the source and Main is the destination).
5. After two more commits in report branch, we merge it as well into the main branch.
