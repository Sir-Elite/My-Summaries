## Creating Repos
Because of all the benifits mentioned before (working as team on the same project, saving every version of the work, ... etc.), you will most probably need to create a git repo using the 'git init' command.

### To check the new repo is working we can:
#### step 1. Change Directory to the recently created repo:
        cd [repo_name]
#### step 2. Check the status of the repo:
        git status

### To convert existing project into a git repo:
We run the command 'git init' from our project directory, and Git confirms that an empty repo has been created along with providing the location. Like what is shown in this example:

At this step, Git will recognize modified untracked unstaged files, you can check it yourself by using 'git status'. These files can be added to staging area and be made a commit then as any other files.

### Avoid Nested Repos
The nested repos are repositories within some other repositories, because it will create a '.git' file for each repo. For each commit, Git will get confused "which directory to be updated?".
#### # Generally, nested repos are not necessary except when working on extremely large and complex data projects!
