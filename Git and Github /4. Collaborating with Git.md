## Creating Repos
Because of all the benifits mentioned before (working as team on the same project, saving every version of the work, ... etc.), you will most probably need to create a git repo using the 'git init' command.

### To check the new repo is working we can:
#### step 1. Change Directory to the recently created repo:
        cd [repo_name]
#### step 2. Check the status of the repo:
        git status

### To convert existing project into a git repo:
We run the command 'git init' from our project directory, and Git confirms that an empty repo has been created along with providing the location. Like what is shown in this example:

At this step, Git will recognize modified untracked unstaged files, you can check it yourself by using 'git status'. These files can be added to staging area and be made a commit then as any other files.

### Avoid Nested Repos
The nested repos are repositories within some other repositories, because it will create a '.git' file for each repo. For each commit, Git will get confused "which directory to be updated?".
#### # Generally, nested repos are not necessary except when working on extremely large and complex data projects!

## Working with Remotes
local repos are repos stored on our computer, while remote repo is a repo stored in the cloud through an online repo hosting service such as GitHub.

### Remote repos are important because:
* Different computers can be used to access our project from the remote repo, if the local computer breaks down.
* Colleagues can collaborate with us regardless of their location.

We can copy an existing remote to our computer by cloning them using the 'git clone' command. While remotes can exist locally, it is more common to store them in an online repo hosting service such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or Gitlab. Git stores a remote tag in the new repo's configuration.

When we clone a repo, Git remembers where the original repo was. It does this by storing a remote tag in the new repo's configuration. If we are in a repo, we can list the names of its remotes using git remote.

We can add more remotes by specifying a name for Git to assign. We do this using the git remote add command, and provide two pieces of information - the name that we would like to assign to the remote repo, and the URL, or the path to the directory (if it is a local remote). It is useful to define the remote name as we can use it as a shortcut when merging rather than listing the URL or path.
