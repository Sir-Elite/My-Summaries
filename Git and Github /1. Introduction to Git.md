### Version Control
1. A version both the content of a file compined with its metadata (author, type, location and when it was last saved).
2. Simultaneous and continuous file development
3. Being able to see different versions, combine them or revert changes

Git is a scalable open source version control system that is popular for computer programming and data projects. It is used for:
1. Storing everything
2. Notifying the presence of conflicting content in files
3. Synchronizing work across different people and computers

The Shell or the terminal is the program for executing commands, in addition to previewing, modifying and inspecting files and directories (folders).
