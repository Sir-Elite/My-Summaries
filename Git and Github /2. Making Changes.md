## Commit Structure
1. Commit itself: contains the metadata
2. Tree: tracks the name and locations in the repo
3. Blob: there is a blob for each file in the tree which is a short binary search. It may contain data of any kind and compressed snapshots of a file's contents.

* The "56daf65" and other identifiers in the commit part is called "hash"
* The tree represent the modified files
* The blob connects the file in the tree with its last modification content
#### This data can be represented using Git Log
