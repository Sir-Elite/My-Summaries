## Request Methods (CRUD)
1. `POST`: Send Data (Create)
2. `GET`: Retrieve Data (Read)
3. `PUSH/PATCH`: Update Data (Update)

   `PUSH` usually replaces an entire resource, whereas `PATCH` usually is for partial updates.
5. `DELETE`: Delete Data (Delete)

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
URLs are a fundamental concept in Web APIs. A URL is a structured address pointing to a specific resource. Via a URL, we can specify what resource we want to interact with.

### Notes:
* "Subdomain" and "Domain Name" (or simply the "Domain") + "Port" represents the server's `host` data.
* "Path" is put directly after the `/`.
* "Queries" start with the `?` sign.
* "Parameters" are separated with `&` for multiple parameter queries.

### Documentation Syntax:
Some documentations use curly braces like `users/{username}`, while others use colon syntax like `users/:username`.

### Examples:
1. `GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape&size=500X400`
2. `GET https//api.github.com/users/{username}` --> `GET https//api.github.com/users/Sir-Elite`
3. `GET https//api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repoName}` --> `GET https//api.github.com/repos/Sir-Elite/My-Summaries`
4. In the following request we want to get books by "id". We will enter the parameters:
   `GET https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books/:id`
