## Request Methods (CRUD)
1. `POST`: Send Data (Create)
2. `GET`: Retrieve Data (Read)
3. `PUSH/PATCH`: Update Data (Update)

   `PUSH` usually replaces an entire resource, whereas `PATCH` usually is for partial updates.
5. `DELETE`: Delete Data (Delete)

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
URLs are a fundamental concept in Web APIs. A URL is a structured address pointing to a specific resource. Via a URL, we can specify what resource we want to interact with.

### URL Components

### Notes:
* "Subdomain" and "Domain Name" (or simply the "Domain") + "Port" represents the server's `host` data.
* "Path" is put directly after the `/`.
* "Queries" start with the `?` sign.
* "Parameters" are separated with `&` for multiple parameter queries.

### Documentation Syntax:
Some documentations use curly braces like `users/{username}`, while others use colon syntax like `users/:username`.

### Examples:
1. `GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape&size=500X400`
2. `GET https//api.github.com/users/{username}` --> `GET https//api.github.com/users/Sir-Elite`
3. `GET https//api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repoName}` --> `GET https//api.github.com/repos/Sir-Elite/My-Summaries`
4. In the following request we want to get books by "id". We will enter the parameters:
   `GET https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books/:id`

## Headers
Headers contain information that describe the message or data being sent or received, such as the type of content we are sending or the date the requested resource was last modified. Headers are always formatted as `key: value` pairs separated by a colon. Each header starts with a case-insensitive key, followed by a colon, and then the value of that header.

### Content Negotiation:
Client and server use message headers to agree on the language they are using to exchange information. Here for example, the client sends the `accept: application/json` header to inform the server it can accept a response in JSON format. When the server responds, it includes the `content-type: application/json` header to let the client know what format it responded with.
