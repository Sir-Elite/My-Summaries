APIs are all about machine-to-machine communication.

### Why do we use APIs?
One of the problems APIs solve is that servers send `HTML` responses. While `HTML` can be translated easily by the browsers, the computers cannot do the same. As a solution to this problem, APIs are installed on the servers once, so it can return data in `XML` or `JSON` for computers to easily understand.
