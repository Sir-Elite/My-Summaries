Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are all about machine-to-machine communication.

## Why do we use APIs?
One of the problems APIs solve is that servers send `HTML` responses. While `HTML` can be translated easily by the browsers, the computers cannot do the same. To solve this problem, APIs are installed on the servers once, so they can return data in `XML` or `JSON` for computers to understand easily.

## A few points about APIs:
* Because APIs respond with readable information, the API Clients can display the same information from the same API using different designs.
* Most of the APIs rely on HTTP to request data.
* Sending requests to APIs has a specific format in the API documentation.
* Even modern websites use APIs behind the scenes to dynamically update content on the screen without any actions taken by users.

## API Types:
1. Hardware API (eg. the mobile camera communication with the mobile operating System)
2. Software Library API (Using methods from a library imported into an application. eg. image processed with filters)
3. Web API (eg. stock prices from finance API)

## API Accessibility:
1. Public
2. Private
3. Partner

## API Architectures:
### 1. REST (Representational State Transfer) --> Lightweight & Flexible Architecture
  * It is an architectural style, not a strict protocol. It outlines a set of principles for designing web services that leverage the underlying HTTP method (eg. `GET`, `POST`, ... etc.).
  * Focus on resources and communicate using HTTP methods.
  * Stateless; does not require servers to remember data from past interactions for a new request-response pair.
  * Flexible to work with `JSON`, `XML`, plain text, and others.

### 2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) --> Stateful Strict Protocol
  * Strict protocol with specific `XML` format for messages over the `HTTP` protocol.
  * Focus on methods (functions), which can be called by clients using `SOAP` messages encapsulated in `HTTP` requests.
  * Can be stateful with some requests.
  * Commonly used in enterprise projects

### 3. GraphQL
  * Takes more sophisticated approach
  * Focus on precise and flexible data retrieval, minimizing data transfer and performance optimization

### 4. WebSockets
### 5. webhooks
### 6. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
### 7. MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)
