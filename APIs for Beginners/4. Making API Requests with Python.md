## URLlib vs Requests
they are two well-known Python libraries for integrating web APIs, such that:
| urllib                                 | requests                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Bundled with Python                    | Many Powerful built-in features |
| Python but not very developer-friendly | Easier to use                   |

### Request example to get a list of music albums:
#### 1. URLlib Code:
    from urllib.request import urlopen
    
    with urlopen('http://localhost:3000/lyrics/') as response:
    
      # Use the correct function to read the response data from the response object
      data = response.read()
      encoding = response.headers.get_content_charset()
      
      # Decode the response data so you can print it as a string later
      string = data.decode(encoding)
      
      print(string)

#### 2. Requests Code
    import requests

    # Pass the API URL to the get function
    response = requests.get("http://localhost:3000/lyrics/")

    # Print out the text attribute of the response object
    print(response.text)

## Requests Library:
It is a library that provides easy access to all "HTTP verbs" or "Request Methods".

### Requests examples:
    query_params = {'floor':77, 'elevator':True}
    response1 = request.get('https://350.5th-ave.com/unit/243', params = query_params)
    url = response1.url
    response2 = request.post('https://350.5th-ave.com/unit/243', data = {"Key": "value"})
    response3 = request.push('https://350.5th-ave.com/unit/243', data = {"Key": "value"})

### Notes:
* `params` in the `get` method is optional.
* `data` in the `post` and the `push` methods is the data passed to the query itself, which is necessary in these cases.
