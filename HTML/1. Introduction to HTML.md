Frontend developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ... etc. HTML is the only language that can build a whole website alone; without the help of any other language.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is well documented in [Mozilla Development Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).

### Heading Elements (h1 --> h6):
    <h1> Heading1 </h1>
    <h2> Heading2 </h2>
    <h3> Heading3 </h3>
    <h4> Heading4 </h4>
    <h5> Heading5 </h5>
    <h6> Heading6 </h6>

This what a heading element looks like; with openning `<h>`, closing `</h1>` tags, and content `"Heading1"`. The have different font sizes with `h1` is the biggest and `h6` is the smallest.

### Displaying Text
    <div>
      <h1>Technology</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><span>Self-driving cars</span> are anticipated to replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.</p>
    </div>
    
If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span:
#### 1. The Paragraph Element:
Paragraphs `<p>` contain a block of plain text.
#### 2. Span Element:
<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.

### Void Elements (Self Closing Tags)
#### 1. Horizontal Rule Element:
    <hr />
This prints a horizontal separating line.

#### 2. Break Element:
    <h1> Auguries of Innocence Poem</h1>
    <h2> BY WILLIAM BLAKE </h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
    To see a World in a Grain of Sand    <br />
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower     <br />
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand     <br />
    And Eternity in an hour    <br />
    A Robin Red breast in a Cage
    </p>
Insert break lines within a paragraph or outside it. It was used in this example to separate the lines of a poem. It can be used as either `<br />` or `<br>`.

### Divisions
    <body>
      <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
          <h3>Species</h3>
          <h3>Features</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
          <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Media</h2>
      </div>
    </body>
It is used to divide the elements and put them into different divisions (containers).

### Attributes
Attributes are made up of the following two parts:
* The name of the attribute
* The value of the attribute
#### 1. Id:
    <div id="intro">
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    </div>
 We can use the id attribute to specify different content (such as <div>s) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once. 

### Text Styling:
    <p>
        <strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).
    </p>
Browsers have built-in style sheets that will generally style these tags in the following ways:
* The `<em>` tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
* The `<strong>` will generally render as bold emphasis.

### Unordered List:
    <ul>
      <li>Limes</li>
      <li>Tortillas</li>
      <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>
We need the unordered list tag `<ul>`, and the individual list item tag `<li>`.
