Frontend developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ... etc. HTML is the only language that can build a whole website alone; without the help of any other language.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is well documented in [Mozilla Development Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).

### Heading Elements (h1 --> h6):
    <h1> Heading1 </h1>
    <h2> Heading2 </h2>
    <h3> Heading3 </h3>
    <h4> Heading4 </h4>
    <h5> Heading5 </h5>
    <h6> Heading6 </h6>

This what a heading element looks like; with openning `<h>`, closing `</h1>` tags, and content `"Heading1"`. The have different font sizes with `h1` is the biggest and `h6` is the smallest.

### The Paragraph Element:
    <p> This is a paragraph. </p>

### Horizontal Rule Element (Self-Closing Element):
    <hr />
This prints a horizontal separating line.
