Frontend developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ... etc. HTML is the only language that can build a whole website alone; without the help of any other language.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is well documented in [Mozilla Development Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).

### Heading Elements (h1 --> h6):
    <h1> Heading1 </h1>
    <h2> Heading2 </h2>
    <h3> Heading3 </h3>
    <h4> Heading4 </h4>
    <h5> Heading5 </h5>
    <h6> Heading6 </h6>

This what a heading element looks like; with openning `<h>`, closing `</h1>` tags, and content `"Heading1"`. The have different font sizes with `h1` is the biggest and `h6` is the smallest.

### The Paragraph Element:
    <p> This is a paragraph. </p>

### Void Elements (Self Closing Tags)
#### 1. Horizontal Rule Element:
    <hr />
This prints a horizontal separating line.

#### 2. Break Element:
    <h1> Auguries of Innocence Poem</h1>
    <h2> BY WILLIAM BLAKE </h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
    To see a World in a Grain of Sand    <br />
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower     <br />
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand     <br />
    And Eternity in an hour    <br />
    A Robin Red breast in a Cage
    </p>
Insert break lines within a paragraph or outside it. It was used in this example to separate the lines of a poem.

### Divisions
    <body>
      <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
          <h3>Species</h3>
          <h3>Features</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
          <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Media</h2>
      </div>
    </body>
It is used to divide the elements and put them into different divisions (containers).
