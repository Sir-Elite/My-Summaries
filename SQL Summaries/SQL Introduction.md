### The five most major advantages to using traditional relational databases, which we interact with using SQL:
1. SQL is easy to understand.
2. Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
3. Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
4. SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
5. SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.

There is SQL (Structure Query Language) and NoSQL (not only SQL). NoSQL environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets the way we have been analyzing data up to this point. One of the most popular NoSQL languages is called MongoDB.

### Businesses Like Databases for:
1. Data integrity is ensured: only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database.
2. Data can be accessed quickly: SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results.
3. Data is easily shared: multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.

### There are various SQL Database Management Systems (DBMS) like:
1. MySQL
2. Microsoft Access
3. Oracle SQL
4. Microsoft SQL Server
5. PostgreSQL
6. SQLite

These summaries are mostly about PostgreSQL, eventhough the other SQL databases are not that different. Learning one SQL will allow you to easily pick up many other SQL programming.
