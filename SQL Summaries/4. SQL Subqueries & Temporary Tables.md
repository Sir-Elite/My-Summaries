# Subqueries
* Subqueries is about building queries upon the results of another query.
* Subqueries are also known as "inner queries" and "nested queries".
* Subqueries **must** have aliasing.
* When writing Subqueries, it is easy for your query to look incredibly complex. In order to assist your reader, which is often just yourself at a future date, formatting SQL will help with understanding your code. A well formated query is shown in "**Example 2**" below.
* Alias should not be included when writing a subquery in a conditional statement. This is because the subquery is treated as an individual value (or set of values in the `IN` case) rather than as a table.


## Examples:
### Example 1:
    SELECT channel, AVG(events_num)
    FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', occurred_at), channel,
          COUNT(*) AS events_num
          FROM web_events
          GROUP BY 1, 2
          ORDER BY 3 DESC
          ) sub
    GROUP BY channel

### Example 2 ((Well Formated Query)):
    SELECT *
    FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
                 channel, COUNT(*) as events
          FROM web_events 
          GROUP BY 1,2
          ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub
    GROUP BY day, channel, events
    ORDER BY 2 DESC;

### Examples 3:
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at), AVG (standard_qty) standard,
           AVG (gloss_qty) gloss, AVG (poster_qty) poster,
           SUM (total_amt_usd) total_spent
    FROM orders
    WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = (
          SELECT MIN(DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at))
          FROM orders
          )
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)
