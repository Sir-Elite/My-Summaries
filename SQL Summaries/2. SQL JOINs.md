### The real power of SQL comes from working with data across multiple tables at once.

### Why the tabels of relational databases are kept in multiple tables?
Some of the reasons are:
1. Sometimes the data gets repeated and take bigger storage size if we kept it all in one table. For example: if `orders` and `accounts` were in the same table, all of the account data would have been repeated with everytime the user makes an order. But this way kept repaeating the `account_id` only, and the `account_id` can link to the data of the account owner in the `accounts` table.
2. The lesser amount of data the query needs to read and the calculations it needs to make, the faster it executes.
3. To ease access seperation from different database users.
