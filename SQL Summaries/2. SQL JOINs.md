### The real power of SQL comes from working with data across multiple tables at once.

# Relational Database

#### The **PK** stands for primary key. A primary key exists in every table, and it is a column that has a unique value for every row. It is common that the primary key is the first column in our tables in most databases.
#### The **FK** stands for foreign key. A foreign key is a column in one table that is a primary key in a different table.
#### Choosing the set up of data in our database is very important, which is not usually the job of a data analyst. This process is known as Database Normalization.

### Why the tabels of relational databases are kept in multiple tables?
Some of the reasons are:
1. Sometimes the data gets repeated and take bigger storage size if we kept it all in one table. For example: if `orders` and `accounts` were in the same table, all of the account data would have been repeated with everytime the user makes an order. But this way kept repaeating the `account_id` only, and the `account_id` can link to the data of the account owner in the `accounts` table.
2. The lesser amount of data the query needs to read and the calculations it needs to make, the faster it executes.
3. The updates for bigger dataset takes more computational efforts and time.
4. To ease access seperation from different database users.

# JOINs:
JOINs make the queries more complex. It tells the query an additional table from which you would like to pull data.

## How to Use JOIN ... ON ...:
We use `JOIN` to specify the additional table, and `ON` to specifies the column on which you'd like to merge the two tables together (should always be the PK equal to the FK, but SQL allows otherwise).

## JOIN Types:
1. **Inner JOIN**:

   Returns only the rows where there's a match in both tables based on a common column. Think of it like finding intersections between two sets of data.
   `JOIN` = `INNER JOIN`
3. **Outer JOIN**:

    Outer JOIN fills in unmatched data with `NULL` values for the non-matching table's columns. It has three types:
    * `LEFT JOIN` = `LEFT OUTER JOIN`: Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
    * `RIGHT JOIN` = `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`: Includes all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
    * `FULL JOIN` = `OUTER JOIN` = `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Includes all rows from both tables, regardless of whether there's a match.

## Alias in JOIN:
When we JOIN tables together, it is nice to give each table an alias to use it in the query instead of the whole name of the table, which is usually larger.

#### Instead of using AS:
    1.  FROM tablename AS t1
        JOIN tablename2 AS t2
    -------------------------------------
    2.  SELECT col1 + col2 AS total, col3
#### We can use space:
    1.  FROM tablename t1
        JOIN tablename2 t2
    -------------------------------------
    2.  SELECT col1 + col2 total, col3

## Pro Tip:
Logic in the `ON` clause reduces the rows before combining the tables, while logic in the `WHERE` clause occurs after the `JOIN` occurs. Think of this as building the new result set using the `ON` clause, then resulted set is filtered using the `WHERE` clause.

## Examples
### Example 1:
    SELECT w.channel, a.primary_poc, w.occurred_at, a.name
    FROM web_events w
    JOIN accounts a
    ON w.account_id = a.id
    WHERE a.name LIKE 'Walmart';

### Example 2:
    SELECT *
    FROM web_events
    JOIN accounts
    ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id
    JOIN orders
    ON accounts.id = orders.account_id;

### Example 3:
    SELECT orders.*
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;

### Example 4:
    SELECT a.name account, s.name sales_rep, r.name region
    FROM sales_reps s
    JOIN region r
    ON r.id = s.region_id
    JOIN accounts a
    ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
    ORDER BY a.name;

### Example 5:
    SELECT a.name account, r.name region, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total+0.01) unit_price
    FROM accounts a
    JOIN orders o
    ON a.id = o.account_id
    AND o.standard_qty > 100    AND    poster_qty > 50
    JOIN sales_reps s
    ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
    JOIN region r
    ON r.id = s.region_id
    ORDER BY unit_price DESC;

### Example 6:
    SELECT DISTINCT a.name account, w.channel
    FROM accounts a
    JOIN web_events w
    ON a.id = w.account_id
    AND a.id = 1001;

### Example 7:
    SELECT o.occurred_at, a.name, o.total, o.total_amt_usd
    FROM orders o
    JOIN accounts a
    ON o.account_id = a.id
    AND o.occurred_at BETWEEN '2015-01-01' AND '2016-01-01'
    ORDER BY o.occurred_at DESC;
