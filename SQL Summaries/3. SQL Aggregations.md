### NULL
`NULL` means no data. NULLs are different than a zero - they are cells where data is missing. They usually happen because of:
1. Performing and outer JOIN
2. Simply missing data in the database.

# Aggregations
Aggregators only aggregate vertically - the values of a column. If you want to perform a calculation across rows, you would do this with simple arithmetic. They usually ignore `NULL` cells.
## Aggregation Functions:
1. `COUNT()`: counts the number of rows, and it can be applied to any type of columns.
2. `SUM()`: sums the numeric values in the column.


## Examples
### Example 1:
    SELECT *
    FROM accounts
    WHERE primary_poc IS NOT NULL

### Example 2:
    SELECT COUNT(primary_poc)
    FROM accounts

### Example 3:
    SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) standard_amt_usd_per_unit
    FROM orders
