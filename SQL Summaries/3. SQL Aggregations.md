### NULL
`NULL` means no data. NULLs are different than a zero - they are cells where data is missing. They usually happen because of:
1. Performing and outer JOIN
2. Simply missing data in the database.

# Aggregations
Aggregators only aggregate vertically - the values of a column. If you want to perform a calculation across rows, you would do this with simple arithmetic. They usually ignore `NULL` cells.
## Aggregation Functions:
1. `COUNT()`: counts the number of rows, and it can be applied to any type of columns.
2. `SUM()`: sums the numeric values in the column.
3. `MIN()`: gets the minimum depending on the column type, it returns the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as early in the alphabet as possible.
4. `MAX()`: gets the maximum depending on the column type, it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to “Z”.
5. `AVG()`: returns the average (mean) of the values in a specific column.
6. `GROUP BY`: aggregates the dataset into subsets. We can `GROUP BY` multiple coulumns at once, knowing that the order of column names in a `GROUP BY` clause doesn’t matter. Any column that is not within an aggregation must show up in the `GROUP BY` statement, otherwise, it is an error.

## Examples
### Example 1:
    SELECT *
    FROM accounts
    WHERE primary_poc IS NOT NULL

### Example 2 ((Sales Reps / Region)):
    SELECT r.name region, COUNT(s.id) sales_reps
    FROM sales_reps s
    JOIN region r
    ON r.id = s.region_id
    GROUP BY region
    ORDER BY sales_reps;

### Example 3 ((Price / Unit)):
    SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) standard_amt_usd_per_unit
    FROM orders;

### Example 4 ((Median Calculation)):
    SELECT *
    FROM    (SELECT total_amt_usd
            FROM orders
            ORDER BY total_amt_usd
            LIMIT   (SELECT COUNT(total_amt_usd) / 2
                    FROM orders) + 1 
            ) AS Table1
    ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
    LIMIT 2;

### Example 5:
    SELECT a.name account, MIN(o.total_amt_usd) smallest_order_total_usd
    FROM orders o
    JOIN accounts a
    ON a.id = o.account_id
    GROUP BY account
    ORDER BY smallest_order_total_usd;
