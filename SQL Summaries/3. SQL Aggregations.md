### NULL
`NULL` means no data. NULLs are different than a zero - they are cells where data is missing. They usually happen because of:
1. Performing and outer JOIN
2. Simply missing data in the database.

# Aggregations
## Aggregation Functions:
1. `COUNT()`: counts the number of rows, and it can be applied to any type of columns.


## Examples
### Example 1:
    SELECT *
    FROM accounts
    WHERE primary_poc IS NOT NULL

### Example 2:
    SELECT COUNT(primary_poc)
    FROM accounts
