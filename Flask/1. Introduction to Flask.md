There are different backend frameworks in Python like:
* Flask [Better suited for beginners and small projects]
* Django [Better suited for much more bigger projects]
* Bottle
* Cherry pie
* Pyramid

#### As a simple example of a Flask program:
    from flask import Flask
    
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    def hello_world():
        return "Hello, World!"

if we save it in a file called `hello.py`, we can run it using `flask --app hello run`. In the terminal, the response comes with a local browser link to the created website.
##### OR we can write it as:
    from flask import Flask
    
    app = Flask(__name__)            # "__name__" : The name of the class, function, method or discriptor is being run

    @app.route("/")                  # "/" as the route goes to the home page of a website
    def hello_world():
        return "Hello, World!"

    if __name__ == "__main__":      # If we are running the code from this current exact file
    # "__main__" : We are executing the script of a particular local module not imported module as a script or from an interactive prompt
        app.run(debug=True)

,and run it directly from the IDE.


### Decorator Function 
    def decorator_function (function)
        def wrapper_function:
            function()
        return wrapper_function

#### Example:
    import time
    
    def delay_decorator (function)
        def wrapper_function:
            time.sleep(2)
            function()
        return wrapper function

    @delay_decorator
    def say_hello():
        print("Hello!")

    def say_greeting():
        print("How are you?")

    def say_bye():
        print("Bye!")

    say_hello()                                                        # Gets delayed by 2 seconds
    say_greeting()                                                     # No Delay
    decorate_function = delay_decorator(say_bye)
    decorated_function()                                               # Gets delayed by 2 seconds
