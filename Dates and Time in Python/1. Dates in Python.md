#### Create a Date Object:
    from datetime import date
    birthday_date = date(2002,8,22)
    print(birthday_date.year)
    print(birthday_date.month)
    print(birthday_date.day)
    print(birthday_date.weekday())

#### Math with Dates
    from datetime import date, timedelta
    date1 = date(2017,11,5)
    date2 = date(2017,12,4)
    delta = date2 - date1        # returns a date object
    print(delta.days)            # outputs the days' difference between the two dates
    td = timedelta(days = delta.days)
    print(date1 + td)            # outputs date2
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Put the dates in order
    dates_ordered = sorted(dates_scrambled)

    # Print the first and last ordered dates
    print(dates_ordered[0])
    print(dates_ordered[-1])

#### Turning dates into strings
    d = date(2017,11,5)
    print(d)                          # date object gets printed
    print([d.isoformat()])            # date is printed in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    print(d.striftime("Year is %Y"))
We want to put dates back into strings when, for example, we want to print results, but also if we want to put dates into filenames, or if we want to write dates out to CSV or Excel files.
