# Common Commands in JavaScript
In JavaScript, semicolons (`;`) are not strictly required at the end of every line of code. However, semicolons are highly recommended for the following reasons:
* **Clarity and Consistency**: Explicitly adding semicolons makes your code easier to read and maintain, especially for others or for your future self. It avoids ambiguity and ensures consistent interpretation.
* **Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)**: While ASI can insert semicolons in some cases, it's not foolproof. It might not work as expected in complex or minified code, leading to unexpected errors.

## 1. Printing in a Pop-Up
    alert("String")
## 2. Declaring New Variables
    let newVariable1 = "value1"    // mutable
    var newVariable2 = "value2"    // mutable, but function scoped

### A. Primitive Data Types
The most important primitive data types are the first three. `JavaScript` has dynamic typing (we donot manually define the type of a variable, it is done automatically by the language). A variable can be defined with a data type, and then reassigned with new data of a different data type.
#### I. Numbers
Used for decimals and integers `let age=30`.
#### II. String
Used for a sequence of characters `let fullname = "Ahmed Waleed Aldesouky"`.
#### III. Boolean
Used for taking decisions by storing logical type that can only be `true` or `false`.
#### IV. Undefined
Value taken by a variable that is not assigned to a variable.
#### V. Null
Also means "absence of values".
#### VI. Symbol
Value that is unique and cannot be changed.
#### VII. BigInt
Larger integers that the `Number` type can hold.

## 3. If Conditional
    if (var == "value) alert('var value is right')
## 4. Loging Text or String Out in the Console
    console.log("String")
## 5. Get the Data Type
    console.log(typeof "data");
    console.log(typeof 2.0);
    console.log(typeof true);
## 6. Defining a Function
    function satMyName(){
        alert("Name");
    }
## 7. Declaring a Constant
    const myBrithYear = 2002    // immutable
Constants are memory places that can be assigned only to one value without getting changed in the rest of the code. Besides, constants can't be left undefined.

## 8. Operators
* Arithmatic Operators (`-`, `+`, `/`, `*` and `**`)
* Assignment Operator (`=`, `++`, `--`, `+=`, `-=`, `/=` and `*=`)
* Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `<=` and `>=`)
####
    1 == '1'     // true (equality checks the equal values)
    1 != '1'     // false
    1 === '1'    // false (strict equality checks the values and the types)
    1 !== '1'    // true

## 9. Joining Strings
    console.log("Ahmed" + " " + "Waleed")

## 10. Precedence in Operations
The operations of 
1. Grouping (Parentheses `()`)
2. Exponentiation (`**`)
3. Multiplication (`*`) and Division (`/`)
4. Addition (`+`) and Subtraction (`-`)
5. Comparison Operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`)
6. Logical AND (`&&`)
7. Logical OR (`||`)
8. Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.)
9. Member Access (`.`), `[]`)
10. Increment/Decrement (`++`, `--`)

## 11. Writing on the Browser
### I. from an Internal Script
    <script>
        document.write("Internal Script <br/>")
    </script>
### II. from an External Script
    document.write("External Script <br
and use the linking technique of adding the script in the `src` attribute.
