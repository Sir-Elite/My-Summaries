### Core Parts of Web Development

`JavaScript` is a scripting (working on the server side - backend) and programming (working on the client side - frontend) language. It help in implementing complex features on a web page by making it interactive. It is simply a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm, light-weight, dynamic, untyped scripting language. `JavaScript` can:
1. Dynamically Update Content
2. Manipulating `HTML` and `CSS`
3. Animate Images, Content, and Create Image Gallery
4. Manipulate and Validate Data
5. Control Multimedia (Audio, Video, ... etc.)
6. Create Web Browser Games
7. Create Mobile Applications

### Steps for Using Browser's Developer Tools:
1. Open Browser (Google Chrome Recommended)
2. Right Click
3. Inspect

Instead of 2&3 we can use ("ctrl" + "shift" + "J")

4. Sources
5. Snippets
6. New Snippet and Rename it "chosen_name.js"
7. Write the JavaScript Code

### Coding Scripts
#### We can:
1. Create a `JavaScript` script ---> `script.js`.
2. Create a website using `HTML` ---> `index.html`.
3. Access the script in the `HTML` code using `<script>` tag and the `src` attribute.
#####
    <body>
        <h1> This is my first JavaScript Project ZeroToOne</h1>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>

#### or we can simply write the javascript code in the `<script>` tag

## Data Types

### A. Primitive Data Types
The most important primitive data types are the first three. `JavaScript` has dynamic typing (we donot manually define the type of a variable, it is done automatically by the language). A variable can be defined with a data type, and then reassigned with new data of a different data type.
#### I. Numbers
Used for decimals and integers `let age=30`.
#### II. String
Used for a sequence of characters `let fullname = "Ahmed Waleed Aldesouky"`.
#### III. Boolean
Used for taking decisions by storing logical type that can only be `true` or `false`.
#### IV. Undefined
Value taken by a variable that is not assigned to a variable.
#### V. Null
Also means "absence of values".
#### VI. Symbol
Value that is unique and cannot be changed.
#### VII. BigInt
Larger integers that the `Number` type can hold.

### B. Composite Data (Objects)

### Checking for Errors
We can find errors in our code using the console from the browser used.
